Namaskara! 

I am Karthikeya, and you have landed on my personal website. I am a 
recent Master's graduate from the Technical University of Munich, where
I majored in Computational Science and Engineering. Towards the end of 
my M.Sc, I shifted my focus to (Computational) Cognitive Science, and 
I am happy my nomadic-academic rovings have ended! I am home! :)

Currently, I am employed at the Max Planck Institute for 
Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen at the LaCNS lab, and work with Andrea 
E Martin on computational modelling of language comprehension. 
Starting in January 2021, I will work on revamping DORA [Doumas et al. 2008]
as a model of language. For my Master's thesis, I worked on combining Category
theorertic and linguistic concepts to build an incremental model of language
comprehension. Feel free to go through my thesis here - . In it, I used
DORA [Doumas et al. 2008] to map formalism and possible implementation.
It was personally quite thrilling to be able to access something as 
personal as language, and put into mathematical terms, what "comprehension"
means formally! Also, I work on RNNs, and I have put up links to
these projects on my github page. 

Since late 2019, I work (yes, I like cogsci enough to take on two jobs) 
at the CVBE and Crowd Cognition lab at the LMU, Munich, where I focus 
on Computational Social Science. Here, along with Pantelis P. Analytis, 
Bahador Bahrami, Ophelia Deroy and Stefan Herzog, I investigate 
social networks in matters of taste. Specifically, we look at the 
role played by critics and amateurs in recommender systems. I really 
enjoy visualising networks and will put up links to ongoing work shortly.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non fiction works on philosophy, 
neuroscience, psychology, and am currently getting into anarchist philosophy.
I discovered the joys of the zettelkasten (..) early this year, and quite
enjoy having conversations with my memories! Here is the link to my personal notes -  
I picked up Deutsch and boxing in the two years that I spent in Munich, 
and realised I would probably have been a boxer if not for a cognitive scientist, 
and that scares me a bit. I dream of getting a black belt in BJJ in my lifetime!
