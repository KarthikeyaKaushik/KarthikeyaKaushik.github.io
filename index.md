Namaskara! 

I am Karthikeya, and you have landed on my personal website. I am a 
recent Master's graduate from the Technical University of Munich, where
I majored in Computational Science and Engineering. Towards the end of 
my M.Sc, I shifted my focus to (Computational) Cognitive Science, and
 my academic rovings have ended. I am home! :)
 
Here is the link to my [CV](CV-karthikeyakaushik.pdf).

Currently, I am employed at the Max Planck Institute for 
Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen at the LaCNS lab, and work with Andrea 
E Martin on computational modelling of language comprehension. 
Starting in January 2021, I will work on revamping DORA [Doumas et al. 2008]
as a model of language. For my Master's thesis, I worked on combining Category
theorertic and linguistic concepts to build an incremental model of language
comprehension. Feel free to go through my thesis [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02038) . 
In it, I used DORA [Doumas et al. 2008] to map formalism and possible implementation.
It was personally quite thrilling to be able to access something as 
personal as language, and put into mathematical terms, what "hierarchy"
means, formally! Also, I work on RNNs, and I have put up links to
these projects on my github page. 

Since late 2019, I work (yes, I like cogsci enough to take on two jobs) 
at the CVBE and Crowd Cognition lab at the LMU, Munich, where I focus 
on Computational Social Science. Here, along with Pantelis P. Analytis, 
Bahador Bahrami, Ophelia Deroy and Stefan Herzog, I investigate 
social networks in matters of taste. Specifically, we look at the 
role played by critics and amateurs in recommender systems. 
[Here](pages/social_network.md) is a short description.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non fiction works on philosophy, 
neuroscience, psychology, and am currently getting into anarchist philosophy.
I discovered the joys of the [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) early this year, and quite
enjoy having conversations with my memories! In my current personal project, 
I am making my zettlekasten more interesting using NLP techniques. 
I picked up Deutsch and boxing in the two years that I spent in Munich, 
and want to restart training after Covid. I also dream of a black 
belt in BJJ (Love the "flow" of martial arts). A trans 
Himalayan trek, from Assam in India to Afghanistan is also a personal
goal!
